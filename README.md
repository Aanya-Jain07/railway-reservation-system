# Railway Reservation System

A Python + MySQL backend project designed to simulate a real-world railway ticket reservation system. Users can book, check, and cancel tickets, with authentication features and database-driven operations.

## Core Functionalities

- **User Authentication**: Sign Up, Sign In, and Exit
- **Ticket Operations**: Booking, Viewing, Cancellation
- **Account Dashboard**: View personal booking history
- **Unique Ticket ID Generation**: Integrated with AI logic
- **Train Details**: Sample data currently powered via AI
- **Database Integration**: Passenger and train data stored using MySQL

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core logic and terminal interface
- **MySQL**: Storage layer for trains and passengers
- **AI Elements**: Used for ID generation and train information augmentation

## Future Enhancements

- Seat selection and schedule tracking features
- GUI interface (Tkinter or web frontend with React)
- Fully deployable public version with frontend + backend
- Smarter train data generation powered by AI
- Cleaner modular code for scalability

## About

This project was developed as part of my Class 12 Computer Science coursework and continues to evolve as I learn more about backend and full stack development. It represents my journey into real-world systems and my curiosity to make tech accessible and intelligent.
